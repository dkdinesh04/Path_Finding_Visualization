It helps you see how path finding algorithms find the most efficient route
between source to target on a grid.

You can set start and end points, create mazes, choose algorithm, and watch the
Process in action.Itâ€™s a fun visual way to understand how different strategies
navigate through obstacles to find the shortest path.
